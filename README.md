# Stock Analysis
General purpose stock analysis project.

## Coding Standard
- Braces are K&R style
   - Functions have braces on new line
   - Non-functions have braces on same line
- StrongCamelCase for classes, structs, enums, etc. (all types)
- underscore_vars for vars and public functions
- _underscore_funcs for private functions
- struct_data_members follow normal variable naming conventions
- var_name_ for class members

## Datasets
All data I use was pulled from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/qks1lver/nasdaq-and-nyse-stocks-histories)
