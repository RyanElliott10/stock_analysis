/*
 Plans for the pattern detector implementation:
 
 Current Issues:
    - Since it's an object and I only made one instance, everything shares it
    - The object is setup such that whenever it is called, it adds data from all the previous tickers and compares that
 
 Plans to Fix the Issues:
    - Change the stock class such that each stock has a PatternDetector member
    - Change the PatternDetector class such that it simply creates temp vars whenever the detect_pattern function is called
    - As of right now, I'm leaning towards the latter
    - In addition, it should be changed such that you can call the pattern_detector function accepts different pattern lengths and repetitions, rather than initalizing the object with a set pattern.
        - However, in the future, this can cause design issues because you'll likely end up with a set of patterns that I would always go to
        - Change it so that it returns an array of the pattern_detected booleans
